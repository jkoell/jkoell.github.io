Our paper *"Progressive oxygenation of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre"* was published in JGR: Oceans last month! The paper is open access, and is available [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024JC022157), and code used for creating the figures is available on my GitHub: [(https://github.com/jkoell/SPNA-ventilation)](https://github.com/jkoell/SPNA-ventilation).

In this paper, we investigate how oxygen is taken up and exported from the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean (SPNA). The figure below summarizes the main findings, showing the annual mean air-sea gas exchange and mean oxygen concentrations along a section at 45N. Four key processes are labeled in the figure:

1. Old, oxygen-poor water enters the subpolar North Atlantic with the North Atlantic Current
2. Oxygen is taken up from the atmosphere throughout the SPNA, **mostly within the upper branch of the AMOC**
3. As mode waters are progressively modified, **oxygen accumulates along the subpolar gyre’s path**
4. Deep Western Boundary current exports oxygen-rich North Atlantic Deep Water

These findings greatly improve our understanding of how the SPNA is ventilated, and can provide important constraints for future projections of ocean deoxygenation.
