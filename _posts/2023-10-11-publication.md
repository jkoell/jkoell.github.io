We just had a new paper accepted in Frontiers in Marine Science, titled *"Decadal variability of oxygen uptake, export, and storage in the Labrador Sea from observations and CMIP6 models"* A preprint is available [here](/assets/pdf/Decadal_ventilation_changes_website.pdf), and the final paper will be uploaded at [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1202299/](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1202299/). The code used for calculating CMIP6 model scores in the paper is available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/jkoell/labrador-sea-oxygen)
