Our recent [paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024JC022157) was featured as a StoryMap on the ECCO group's website: [https://ecco-group.org/publications-featured.htm](https://ecco-group.org/publications-featured.htm)!

The StoryMap is designed to explain our findings to a general audience, and you can check it out either on the ECCO website above or in the [Research](/research) section on this website.

ECCO, or Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, is an ocean state estimate that provides four-dimensional fields of ocean physics, and the ECCO-Darwin product expands this to ocean biogeochemistry. 

The StoryMaps was created by [ODYSEA](https://odyseallc.com) as part of a series that highlights publications utilizing ECCO data.
