I am an observational oceanographer, and currently work as a researcher in the School of Oceanography at the University of Washington, working with [Alison Gray](https://alisonrgray.com). My main research focus is studying ocean ventilation from BGC-Argo floats; see [Research](/research) for more details.

Prior to my current position, I was a CICOES postdoctoral fellow at UW from 2023 and 2025, a postdoc at Dalhousie University from 2020 to 2023, and received my PhD in Oceanography from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 2020.
