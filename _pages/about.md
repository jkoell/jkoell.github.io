I'm a [CICOES postdoctoral fellow](https://cicoes.uw.edu/education/postdoc-program/current-postdoctoral-researchers/) at the University of Washington and NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, working with [Alison Gray](https://alisonrgray.com) at UW and with Greg Johnson and Andrea Fassbender in the [Global Observations of Biogeochemistry and Ocean physics (GOBOP) group](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/gobop) at PMEL. My main research focus is studying ocean ventilation from BGC-Argo floats; see [Research](/research) for more details.

Prior to my current position, I was a postdoc at Dalhousie University from 2020 to 2023, and received my PhD in Oceanography from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 2020.
