The figure below shows an annual cycle of oxygen changes in different isopycnal layers that are due to ventilation. This is calculated as the difference between the oxygen inventory change in the corresponding isopycnal layer, minus the change that is just due to an increase in layer thickness, i.e.

O2(t)H(t) - O2(mean)H(t)

This calculations removes the dominant signal of layer thickness changes on the oxygen inventory, with the residual representing the fraction that is due to oxygen uptake from the atmosphere.
