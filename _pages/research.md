My primary research interests are at the intersection of ocean physics and biogeochemistry, using observations from [BGC-Argo](https://biogeochemical-argo.org), moorings, and hydrography to study how processes such as ocean currents and deep water formation influence the distribution and variability of dissolved gases in the ocean.

## Ocean ventilation

Ocean ventilation is the term generally used for the ''breathing'' of the ocean. Different authors define ventilation in different ways, but in my work I generally use the term to mean the uptake of oxygen from the atmosphere at the surface of the ocean, and its export away from the source region by physical transport. Using a budget approach, this export can be inferred by combining measurements or estimates of oxygen content change, air-sea gas exchange, and biological activity.

The above figure shows an estimate of this oxygen export for the global ocean using the [GOBAI-O2 product](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/gobai/). The red color shows regions where there is a net uptake of oxygen from the atmosphere, which is balanced by an oxygen export out of the region. These generally align with areas of intermediate or deep water formation (subpolar North Atlantic and Southern Ocean), upwelling systems (Humboldt, California, Canary, Benguela, and Somali Currents), and Western Boundary Currents (Kuroshio and Gulf Stream). The focus of my current work is to study the underlying processes and variability in the subpolar North Atlantic.
