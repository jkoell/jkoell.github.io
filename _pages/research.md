My primary research interests are at the intersection of ocean physics and biogeochemistry, using observations from [BGC-Argo](https://biogeochemical-argo.org), moorings, and hydrography to study how processes such as ocean currents and deep water formation influence the distribution and variability of dissolved gases in the ocean.

## Ocean ventilation

![Text](/assets/images/exp_global_l13.jpg)

Ocean ventilation is the term generally used for the "breathing" of the ocean. Different authors define ventilation in different ways, but in my work I generally use the term to mean the uptake of oxygen from the atmosphere at the surface of the ocean, and its export away from the source region by physical transport. Using a budget approach, this export can be inferred by combining measurements or estimates of oxygen content change, air-sea gas exchange, and biological activity.

The above figure shows an estimate of this oxygen export for the global ocean using the [GOBAI-O2 product](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/gobai/). The red color shows regions where there is a net uptake of oxygen from the atmosphere, which is balanced by an oxygen export out of the region. These generally align with areas of intermediate or deep water formation (subpolar North Atlantic and Southern Ocean), upwelling systems (Humboldt, California, Canary, Benguela, and Somali Currents), and Western Boundary Currents (Kuroshio and Gulf Stream). 

The focus of my current work is to study ocean ventilation in the subpolar North Atlantic in order to better understand the underlying processes and their spatial patterns and temporal variability. Some of my previous work focused on more specific aspects of ocean ventilation in the Labrador Sea, and is briefly summarized below.

#### Air-sea gas exchange

Air-sea gas exchange is one of the most crucial processes for ocean ventilation, as it sets the amount of oxygen taken up at the ocean's surface. The way that it is typically calculated is by using a gas exchange parameterization, which in its simplest form is a function of wind speed and the difference in oxygen concentration between ocean and atmosphere. However, many gas exchange parameterizations have been tuned for carbon fluxes, and constrained by either global values, or measurements from field campaigns from specific regions. In [Koelling et al., 2017 (GRL)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL073933), we show that there is a large spread in how well different gas exchange parameterizations reproduce the net wintertime flux of oxygen into the ocean in the Labrador Sea. We find that parameterizations that account for bubble dissolution perform better than those that do not, and also show that the choice of wind speed product can have a large effect on the calculated fluxes.

#### Oxygen export

Water is brought into the Labrador Sea through a boundary current entering from the Irminger Sea, which flows counterclockwise around the basin and exits at the southern end, flowing equatorward along the North American coast. Along its transit through the Labrador Sea, deep waters that form in the center of the basin "join" this boundary current, and are then exported southward. This is a major conduit for the oxygen that is taken up during deep water formation in the Labrador Sea to be exported out of the region, ventilating the global ocean. In [Koelling et al., 2022 (Biogeosciences)](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-437-2022) we use moored oxygen measurements taken within the boundary current to show that this export associated with newly ventilated waters has a seasonal dependence, with most of it flowing out in the 4-5 months following deep convection. We also used the data to obtain a first estimate of the amount of oxygen exported each year through this pathway, which is 1.6 Terramoles, equivalent to up to half of what gets taken up in the interior.
